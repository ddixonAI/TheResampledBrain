Hello!

My name is Derek Dixon, and this is probably going to be yet another blog wherein the author rambles on about their trivial learnings in data science. I am 30 years old, and in 2019 I pivoted my career to data science. Currently, I develop predictive models for large managed care insurer while also pursuing a masters in data science from St. Louis University.

My ideas about what this blog will be are only half-baked and will likely evolve over time as I post. But currently those half-baked ideas are as follows:

**(1)** Attempts to master statistical learning thoroughly and fundamentally. From the abstract theoretical principles, to the practical implementations in various programming languages (R, Python, Julia, although mostly R because I love R). 

**(2)** Other niche things I'm interested in: horror media (books, movies, video games), libertarianism, economics, bodybuilding/powerlifting/weight training, metal music, Competitive Gears of War

If you stumble upon this dark crevice of the internet I hope you leave having found something that made it worth your time.
