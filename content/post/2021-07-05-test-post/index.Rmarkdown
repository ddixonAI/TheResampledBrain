This is a test post. I'll delete this after my first real post.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

data <-
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(10, mean = 10, sd = 2),
    y = rnorm(10, mean = 12, sd = 1)
  )

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ggtitle("Test Plot!")

```
